The hello-world tutorial for git hub

My name is Nolan Corr. I'm 21 years old. I'm from Holly Springs, North Carolina, and I'm currently single. I'm currently a student at Appalachian State University, and I get home by 6:30 at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by around 12:00 am and I make sure to get at least 8 hours of sleep. After having a glass of milk before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Get pranked idiot, this was a Jojo reference the whole time.
